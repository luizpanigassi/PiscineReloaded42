# 42PiscineReloaded

These are the functions created during my first couple of weeks at 42SP. It's a collection of functions in C.

## Overview

This project contains solutions to the early exercises at 42SP, focusing on fundamental C programming concepts. Each exercise is in its own folder and covers topics such as:

- Printing characters, numbers, and strings
- Basic arithmetic and logic
- Recursion and iteration
- String and memory manipulation
- Working with pointers and structs
- Simple shell scripts

The goal was to practice and understand the basics of C by reimplementing common operations and algorithms from scratch.

## Structure

Each subfolder (`ex00`, `ex01`, ...) contains a specific exercise, for example:

- [`ex06/ft_print_alphabet.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex06/ft_print_alphabet.c): Print the alphabet.
- [`ex07/ft_print_numbers.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex07/ft_print_numbers.c): Print numbers 0-9.
- [`ex08/ft_is_negative.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex08/ft_is_negative.c): Check if a number is negative.
- [`ex11/ft_div_mod.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex11/ft_div_mod.c): Divide and modulo two integers.
- [`ex12/ft_iterative_factorial.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex12/ft_iterative_factorial.c): Iterative factorial.
- [`ex13/ft_recursive_factorial.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex13/ft_recursive_factorial.c): Recursive factorial.
- [`ex14/ft_sqrt.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex14/ft_sqrt.c): Integer square root.
- [`ex19/ft_sort_params.c`](reloadeddeliver/ex19/ft_sort_params.c): Sort command-line arguments.
- [`ex22/ft_abs.h`](reloadeddeliver/ex22/ft_abs.h): Absolute value macro.
- [`ex23/ft_point.h`](reloadeddeliver/ex23/ft_point.h): Simple struct for a point.

Some folders contain shell scripts or other small utilities.

## Usage

You can compile and run each C file individually to test its functionality.  
Example:
```
gcc ex06/ft_print_alphabet.c -o print_alphabet
./print_alphabet
```
